<h1>All About Ashlie Webb</h1>
<h2>I like bright colours, textile patterns and that vintage, retro style</h2>
<p>Being a part of the web community these past six years or so has been a great experience for me. Each day has been spent learning something new from colleagues, mentors, writers and speakers.</p>
<p>There is a culture of sharing I try to engage in by attending and speaking at conferences, and getting involved in Community of Practice initiatives.</p>
<p>I have lots of interests aside from this including photography, fashion, environment, natural cosmetics and crime fiction to name a few.</p>
