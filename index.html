<h1>UX designer &amp; frontend developer</h1>
<h2>I love design that people enjoy to use</h2>
<p>With a passion for crafting the UI and creating websites that every person wants to visit, I like to focus on the finer design details.</p>
<p>I understand that many factors attribute to the success of a website, and in turn the business.</p>
